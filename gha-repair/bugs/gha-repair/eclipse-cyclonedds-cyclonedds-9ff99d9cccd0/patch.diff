+            # Justification: Based on the rationale presented by MISRA:
+            #   - The comment occurs within the Bison skeleton files that have
+            #     been checked to not have a missing `*/` ending sequence and
+            #     whose source is not within a repository we maintain.
+            #   - The `//` within a block comment is not as a result of a region
+            #     of code being commented out, but rather as a result of a URL of
+            #     the form "https://..." being present in the comment.
+            #
+            # In addition, introducing infrastructure to remove this in-flight
+            # needlessly adds complexity.
